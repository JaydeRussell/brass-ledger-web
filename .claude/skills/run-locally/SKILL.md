description: Launch and verify Brass Ledger (this frontend, brass-ledger-web, together with the sibling brass-ledger-api backend) against the local Docker Compose stack — rebuild, confirm the containers are current, then drive it with the Chrome browser tools. Use this whenever asked to run, start, screenshot, or click-through-verify a change in the real app.

# Running Brass Ledger locally

Brass Ledger is two repos — this frontend (`brass-ledger-web`) and the
sibling backend (`brass-ledger-api`) — that share one Docker Compose
stack, driven from the backend repo's `run.sh`. There is no working
`npm run dev`/`next dev` path for real click-through testing in this
environment; always go through Docker.

## 1. Rebuild before you test

**`localhost:3000`/`:8080` are NOT source-mounted.** The containers
serve a snapshot built at image-build time; only `logs/` is
bind-mounted. Editing files on disk does nothing to the running app
until you rebuild:

```bash
cd ../brass-ledger-api && ./run.sh -d --build
```

Takes ~30s, rebuilds and restarts both `brass-ledger-frontend-1` and
`brass-ledger-backend-1` (leaves `brass-ledger-db-1` running as-is).

**Don't skip this.** A "the feature I just wrote isn't showing up" or
"still loading" symptom during live testing is almost always a stale
image, not a real bug — confirmed the hard way debugging the
mission-matchup panel on 2026-09-12/13. If you're not sure whether a
rebuild is needed, compare container age to your latest edit before
concluding a live-test failure is a real bug:

```bash
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}\t{{.CreatedAt}}'
stat -f "%Sm %N" path/to/file/you/just/edited.tsx
```

If the container predates the edit, rebuild first.

## 2. Confirm it's up

```bash
docker ps
```

Expect `brass-ledger-frontend-1`, `brass-ledger-backend-1`, and
`brass-ledger-db-1` all `Up`/healthy.

## 3. Drive it with the Chrome browser tools

Load the browser tools if they're deferred, then navigate to
`http://localhost:3000`:

```
ToolSearch("select:mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp,mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate,mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer,mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_page,mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp,mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_close_mcp,mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_console_messages,mcp__claude-in-chrome__read_network_requests")
```

- Screenshot before and after the interaction you're verifying — don't
  just confirm the page loads, actually click through the feature the
  way a user would (open a panel, submit a form, expand a card, etc.).
- Call `read_network_requests`/`read_console_messages` (with a pattern)
  *before* triggering the action you want to observe — both only track
  from the moment they're first called on a tab, so calling them
  afterward misses everything that already happened.
- A signed-in Google account, already linked to a real BCP profile, is
  usable in this stack — most real features (My Events, follows, the
  mission-matchup panel, the feedback widget) need it to be meaningfully
  exercised.
- Close any tab you opened once you're done (`tabs_close_mcp`) — don't
  leave scratch tabs open.

## 4. Read the logs if something's off

The containers are distroless — no shell, so `docker exec ... sh` (or
`bash`/`cat`/`tail`) fails with "executable file not found in $PATH".
Read their stdout with `docker compose logs` instead:

```bash
docker compose -f ../brass-ledger-api/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=30 backend
docker compose -f ../brass-ledger-api/docker-compose.yml logs --tail=30 frontend
```

Backend access-log lines are one JSON object per request (method, uri,
status, latency, user agent) — grep by path or status to confirm a
specific request actually happened the way you expect, rather than
guessing from the UI alone.

**Client-side** events (auth checks, caught errors, uncaught exceptions
— everything through `app/lib/clientLog.ts`) go to the **browser
console**, not to any server log. Read them with the Chrome devtools
MCP tools (`read_console_messages`). There used to be a `logs/`
directory and an `/api/log` route that copied them to disk; both are
gone — see clientLog.ts's own comment for why.
